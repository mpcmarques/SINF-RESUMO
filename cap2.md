## Lecture 2

### Total Enterprise Integration (TEI) _(slide 1)_

The power of TEI is in creating stretegic advantage, rather than improving effiencies.

Aim at achieving the so-called "Business Integration".

TEI contrasts with ERP by integrating many executives systems that fall outside of typical ERP systems.

### Executive Functions

#### Strategic planning _(slide 2)_

##### Kite chart _(slide 2)_

- Top management works with all areas in a company.
- Sales and Marketing focuses on finding and keeping costumers.
- Operations focuses on acquiring materials from suppliers and manufacturing finished products on time and on budget.
- Human Resources focuses on attracting, training, and retaining a qualified work force.
- Research and Development focuses on creating new products.
- Finance and Accounting is the language with which the rest of the company communicates.

##### The company strategic focus _(slide 3)_

Determines the areas in which its TEI systems must excel.

Ex:

- Top management and finance and accounting function are confortable communicating resulsts and plans using financial numbers.
- If a company is going to emphasize quick response, or its strength is engineering.

#### Marketing _(slide 3)_

Fills the space between strategic planning and selling the products.

- Creates the environment in which the costumer decides to buy.
- Includes defining new products and services that costumer wants.
- Providing the means for the costumer to understand how the products benefit their business.
- Decides the costumers to whom the products and services will be offered, and how to price and position the offerings for costomer value.

##### Three techniques _(slide 4)_

Applied to determine what the customer actually wants:

###### Voice of the Customer _(slide 4)_

Includes:

- Ranked costumer expectations and performance metrics.
- Customer perceptions of performance.
- Trend analysis.
- Supply chain process flow analysis.
- Gap analysis - customer expectations vs the company performance.
- Gap analysis - customer perceiptions vs the company perceptions.
- Customer quotes.

###### Market Research _(slide 5)_

Market research is the process of continually reviewing the marketplace to mantain the 4Ps (products, price, promotion, place(distribution)).

Marketing listens to customer desires, sees current competitive products, and hear about potential new competitive products and file those ideas in a new product database.

R&D or Product Engineering also contributes to this database as they visit customers to see how the customers are using the company's existing products.

R&D uses this data as a primary source as they develop new products.

###### Quality Function Deployment (QFD) _(slide 5)_

Is a method of translating higher-level objectives into concrete actions and metrics.

Is used to prioritize, on the basis of customer needs, wants, and expectations, the many ofter-competing features that they could potentially include in their products.

QFD can benefir greatly from using the information about customer needs, wants and expectations from the VOC.

###### Neither VOC nor QFD _(slide 6)_

Are modules in ERP package, howerver, information they create is integral to TEI.

#### Sales and operations planning _(slide 6)_

##### Full supply chain management integration _(slide 6)_

Means partnering with customers and suppliers withe the intent to maximize responsiveness and flexibility, while eliminating paperwork, waste, and cost throught the supply chain.

##### Manufacturers constantly balance alternatives _(slide 7)_

- Adjust inventory levels.
- Adjust capacity.
- Use alternative sources of supply.
- Vary the lead time to the customer.
- Introduce new products.
- Bring in work currently performed by suppliers.
- Outsource some current work to suppliers.
- Purchase semifinished raw material, rather tham doing the initial processing ourselves.

_Virtually all manufacturers perform the S&OP process whether they call it S OP or other therm, they meet moonthly or decide in some other manner. Achieving results from S OP required that a manufacturer use it as a continuous process rather than a monthly meeting_

#### Financial planning _(slide 8)_

The financial and accounting system is the medium of communication and measurement in a manufacturing company.

##### The TEI system contains _(slide 8)_

The detailed plans and data necessary to calculate the top-level financial plan:

- Current customer orders and forecasted sales.
- Contracted and projected labor, including overtime.
- Projected inventory levels, including finished goods in all distribution areas, work in process, and raw materials.

##### The financial planning system can _(slide 8)_

Combine these projections of cash outflows and inflows with other financial data, such as:

- Other contracted and projected income (rent, royalties).
- Other contracted and projected payments (e.g., rent, advertising, etc).

To create detailed financial projections.

#### Executive decision support _(slide 9)_

3 areas (descision support simulation, alert warning systems, business process modeling.)

##### Decision Support Simulaton _(slide 9)_

Simulation tools can help executives understand the impact of strategic and tactical desicions on operating indicators and the P&L.

##### Business Process Modeling (BPM) _(slide 10)_

Tools that allows a company to model its business processes and to simulate throughput and bottlenecks visually, watching the queues build behind bottlenecks.

These tools can be extremely useful in modeling current and proposed business processes in a variely of circumstances, including plant layout, information flows, and TEI implementations.

##### Alert Warning Systems _(slide 10)_

Alert warning systems in TEI systems alert executives when the system detects that threshold value that has been set for a particular attribute has been exceeded.

#### Measurement systems _(slide 11)_

Businness must be flexible to meet the needs of the marketplace.

Proposes new measurement system that recognizes that everything is temporary (products, customers, workers, processes).

All products have life cycles, and should have four key metrics: profitability, time, quality and company spirit.

##### Profitability _(slide 11)_

Traditionally the primary measure of a company's performance.

Howerver, the authors propose that companies measure each department and function on contribution to profit for the entire life cycle of the product.

This contrasts directly with the current practice, in which department goals are often in conflict with each other.

###### Department goals _(slide 11)_

- Sales - contribution to margin, rather than gross revenues.
- Manufacturing and materials - total life cycle cost of producing the product, including acquiring and converting the materials. Purchasing should be part of a manufacturing unit, which has P&L responsibility for its product line.
- Engineering - designing products that make money over the produc's life cycle.

##### Time _(slide 11)_

Standard measurement systems ignore time, even though time is more important measure of process than money.

Time can have at least three dimensions: time to market, time to customer and velocity.

##### Quality _(slide 12)_

The specific measurables for quality should come from the TQM (or similar) effort in the company.

##### Spirit _(slide 12)_

A company is its people.

#### Supply chain management integration _(slide 13)_

Means partnering with customers and suppliers, with the intent to maximize responsiveness and flexibility, while eliminating paperwork, waste and cost throughout the supply chain.

Some differentiate between supply chain and demand chain.

- Supply chain starts with the initial supplier.
- Demand chain contains the same basic steps, but reverses them using a pull phiolosophy.

##### The essence of supply chain management _(slide 13)_

Is a strategic weapon to develop sustainable competitive advantage by reducing investment while assuring customer loyalty.

Successful supply chains require:

- Open sharing of information on the basis of trust and mutual Executive Direction and Support benefit so that all companies can achieve their objectives.

##### Designing and Implementing Supply Chain _(slide 14)_

Involves much more than just TEI.

Five dimensions: Strategy, Infrastructure, Process, Organization, Technology.

###### TEI is the primary information foundation for supply chain _(slide 14)_

Increasing supply chain integration required increases in both the degree of information integration and the amount of information.

Unfortunately, the dificulty of integrating information increases at an accelerated rate with respect to the degree of supply

_Supply chan alias and efficient consumer response targets (slide 16)._
