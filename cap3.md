## Areas of customer focused information

### Full sales support _(slide 2)_

Assisted selling

- involves the interaction between salespeople and consumers, and can occur either outside the company or inside the company.

Unassisted selling

- includes sales via Web sites and kiosks at customer sites.

#### Sales force automation _(slide 3)_

Normally refers to assited selling, outside the company.

Fully integrated TEI system:

- provides the salesperson full access to all TEI functionality, in the field (laptop) and in the office.
- This software should help the salesperson delight the customer.

#### Salespeople really want four basic capabilities _(slide 3)_

##### More and better information

Especially accurate, advance knowledge of customer sales opportunities, competitive threats, and service problems.

##### Better value proposition

Business case development, and sales presentation knowledge and tools.

##### Better and more straightforward ways to manage orders agreements and contracts

##### Simples ways to communicate

With the customer, marketing, service, shipping, each other, and alliance partners.

#### Collaborative selling _(slide 3)_

Is radical, customer-centric approach that involes understanding how their buyers buy, and how to enable the buyer to buy more easily.

Focusing on ways to enable buyer and seller collaboration, especially around problem solving and solution design.

Effective collaborations builds vale and enduring relationships.

Enabling buying and selling work to be aided by data-rich communications tools. Using those tools, a person can track and report work automatically, thereby eliminating the "after-the-fact typing and reporting" burden.

##### Some of the functions of sales force software include: _(slide 4)_

- Support for team selling
- Customer and prospect data mining tools
- Access to marketing literature and competitor data
- Ability to configure products, using the Product Configurator.
- P & L impact of sales propasals.
- Customer sales trends and exceptions.
- Automated salesperson expense reporting system.
- Probability-weighted sales cycle tracking system.
- Easy access to any and all information about a customer.
- Integration with personal Digital Assistants.

### Forecasting integration _(slide 5)_

Forecasts drive capital decisions, both plant and equipment, material volume (and even supplier choice) decisions, staffing decisions, and financial plans.

#### Qualitative Forecasts _(slide 5)_

Are often perceived as "last resort" techniques because there are not enough "hard data" to create a statically valid forecast.

Qualitative methods can frequently provide very accurate forecasts.

The best qualitative forecasts also include commitments from customers.

##### Advantages

- Low cost to develop the forecats.
- Assumpstions and how the forecasts were determined are well understood.
- Small time commitment required.

##### Disadvantages

- Inherent bias by the group that develops them.
- Not consistent over time due to their subjective nature.
- Not well suited for companies with a large number of products.
- Companies that utilize qualitative forecasting methods must manually enter the resulting forecasts into their TEI systems.

#### Quantitive Forecasts _(slide 5)_

Operate on the assumption that the future can be predicted from past data.

Data can come from two basic sources:

- Intrinsic:
  - sources internal to the company, such as shipments of finished goods, number of service contracts signed, MTBF (Men Time Between Failures) on replaceable components, etc.
- Extrinsic
  - sources external to the company, such as housing starts, birth rates, weather, etc.

##### Flaws related to Intrinsic data _(slide 6)_

These data normally reside in a TEI system. Howerver, intrinsic data have three inherent flaws because they reflect the item, quantity, and date actually shipped.

Examples of intrinsic data issues...:

- (item) They show the item sold, not the item the customer originally wanted.
- (date shipped) Potential sales that were missed because manufacturer could not ship at the right time are normally not in the TEI database. Databases may lack the original customer wanted data.
- (past vs future) Past data are not always a good predictor of the furutre.

##### Forecasts are inaccurate _(slide 6)_

Plans based on forecasts should strive to reduce forecast error!

Companies should design their internal systems to:

- communicate changes quickly
- accommmodate the forecast errors as those erros become known.

##### Minimizing the Impact of Forecast Errors _(slide 6)_

- Descrease response lead times.
- The ultimate goal for a manufacturer is to be able to efficiently and effectively manufacture what the customer wants within the customer's lead time.
- Increase visibility with the customer.
- Increase forecast accuracy by monitoring forecast error.

##### Communicate Changes Quickly _(slide 7)_

**Forecasts can be changed** at a sales and operations planning meeting, or the weekly planning meeting, or the daily status meeting.

**No matter when the forecasts change**, a company has to _communicate the full effect of those changes throught its own organization and to its suppliers_.

**A properly designed, properly implemented** fully integrated **TEI system excels at this task**.

### Order generation _(slide 7)_

Encompasses all the methods of bringing customer demand to the manufacturer's attention, including:

- Vendor-Managed Inventory/Continuous Replenishment.
- Eletronic commerce, such as EDI and internet commerce.
- Manually entered orders, from customer phone alls, faxes and mail.
- Kanbans and other manual signals.
- Distribution Resources Planning (DRP).

#### If VMI (Vendor-Managed Inventory) is implemented properly _(slide 8)_

The retailer gains by lowering its administrative costs and by having a higher percentage of items on the shelf at any given time.

The manufacturer gains because:

- Increase business (sales)
- Gains visibility
- Reduce returned goods
- Optimize their outbound shipments

#### Other terms for VMI _(slide 9)_

- JMI: Jointly Managed Inventories
- CPFR: Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment

#### VMI's weakness _(slide 9)_

Customers use it to force inventory responsibility on the manufacturer without becoming true partners in the process.

It can substiantially increase the volume of data from customer to manufacturer:

- Instead of periodic orders, the customer now sends consumption data daily for each item at each DC, or even from each reatil store.

#### VMI must be integrated with the rest of the TEI system _(slide 9)_

To this end, the system must be able to:

- Accept data from the customer electronically.
- Track inventory levels at customer locations.
- Create customer orders automatically.

#### Electronic Commerce / Internet Commerce _(slide 9)_

Utilizes the capability of eletronic commerce to directly enter orders into the manufacturer's computer.

With the potential do dramatically reduce total order processing times.

#### Manual Entered Orders _(slide 9)_

Many customers still rely on the manufacturer to physically enter their orders into the manufacturer's TEI system.

These customers primally use phone calls and faxes to inform the manufacturer of their requirements.

Order entry capabilities have been in the MRP and MRP 2 systems since their inception:

- these modules can be highly robust in current systems, including the ability to predefine the customer's order.

#### When a customer calls to place an order _(slide 10)_

TEI system must be sufficiently responsive

- allow the customer service representative quickly and accurately enter the order while the customer is on the phone.
- providing a firms ship date and a total price for the order.

#### Kanbans and other manual signals _(slide 10)_

Kanbans and other manual signals relay an authorization to ship products to a customer without any paperwork or intervention on the part of customer service.

#### Distribution Resources Planning (DRP) _(slide 10)_

Precursor of Vender-Managed Inventories, it monitors the current and projected future on-hand of finished goods at warehouses, in the same way that MRP monitors the current on-hand and projected usage of inventory inside the plant.

### Order entry _(slide 11)_

Order entry addresses the various options and challenged involved in accpting the demand from the customer, no matter in wich form it has arrived.

#### Some of the issues _(slide 11)_

That must be addressed when a manufacturer selects and implements the order entry module.

- Multiple order types.
- Hnadling large order volumes.
- Pricing and promotions.
- Multiple units of measure.
- Product substitution rules.
- Product allocation and reservation rules.
- Multiple sourcing options for each order line.
- Fully integrated credit checking
- Forecast coordination.

##### Multiple order types _(slide 11)_

- Regular, for standart items.
- Samples for standart items.
- Samples for prototype items.
- Replacement parts, for warranty service.
- Propective (treated as a forecast)
- Drop-ship

##### Handling large volumes of orders _(slide 11)_

- Some TEI systems have been designed, both technically and ergonomically, to support large volumes or orders.
- The manufacturer must also design the workflow of the order entry process to support large volumes.

##### Pricing and promotions _(slide 12)_

Manufacturers that sell to reatilers have considerable difficulty in tracking promotions.

- Orders can arrive from stores in a specific chain for merchangidse that is on promotion
  - but fail to mention the promotion
  - or fail to order the combination of items that is on promotion
- Pricing can be range from relatively simple to extremely compelx, depending on the customer's industry.
- Some customers negotiate allowances / ask for rebates based on purchase volume for one or ore time periods.

##### Multiple units of measure _(slide 12)_

When is a unit of measure not interchangeable?

- When it has been defined by a customer.
  - One customer might insist that six items be packed in a case.
  - Another customer might insist on 8 or 10 or 12 of the same items in a case.

##### Product substitution rules _(slide 12)_

If the requested product will not be available by the ship date, will the customer allow substitution of another product?

If so, waht rules have the customer and manufacturer estabilished?

The rules will be by SKU and by customer.

##### Product allocation and reservation rules _(slide 12)_

Some MPR 2 systems allocate finished goods to an order when the order is entered, regardless of the order ship date.

This prevents an order that is entered later from using these finished goods even its ship date is sooner and additional goods could be procured to satisly the first order.

##### Multiple sourcing options for each order line _(slide 13)_

Usually, each line item on a customer order is shipped from only one location.

Most TEI systems easy allow shipment of different line items from different locations.

##### Fully integrated credit checking _(slide 13)_

Credit checking must be fully integrated with order entry, so that:

- when the order has been completely entered, credit is checked automatically and approved orders go directly to the next step in the customer order fulfillment process.

##### Forecast absorption _(slide 13)_

Forecasts are usually grouped by time periods (month or quarter frequently).

If an order is entered on the first or last day of a time period, how should the manufacturer decide wich forecast that order should be allocated against?

- _The TEI system should allow the manufacturer to specify the forecast tie period into wich the order should be plaed for forecasting purposes_.

### Quoting and promising deliveries _(slide 14)_

Can be done by the salesperson in the customer's office, or anywhere else.

In extremely advancted TEI systems 3 important atttributes to a quote:

- Configuration
- Price
- Delivery date

### Demand management _(slide 14)_

Traditionally, companies have treated customer demand very simply:

- "All customer demand will be fullfilled!" however, not all customer demand benefits a company equally.

Demand management, therefore, is a formal approach to stratifying customer demand, so that:

- Salespeople are given incentive to increase the "best" type of demand.
- When there are resources shortages, the demand that contributes the least to the manufacturer will absorb the shortage.

#### Step 1 - Determine Demand Value _(slide 15)_

DemandValue = .2(customer size) + .1(customer market share) + .3(product profitability) + .2 (market growth) + .2(market strategic importance)

#### Step 2 - Determine Resources Required _(slide 15)_

#### Step 3 - Rank by relative value (demand value / resource requirement). _(slide 15)_

### Logistics and distribution _(slide 15)_

_"That part of the supply chain process that plans, implements, and controls the efficient, effective flow and storage of goods,services and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption in order to meet customers' requirements."_

**Logistics spans many functional boundaries**, including marketing, purchasing, manufacturing, phusical distribution, accounting, and information system.

#### Integration with TEI _(image - slide 16)_

#### Transportation _(slide 16)_

For a long time, MRP 2 and many ERP systems have basically ignored transportation, from both scheduling and cost standpoints.

However, proactive management of transportation alone contributes substantially to many manufacturer's final profit margins.

#### Warehouse Management Systems _(slide 16)_

Warehouse management systems (WMS) increase efficiencies and accuracy of the warehouse functions.

### Field service _(slide 17)_

Provide accurate and reponsive promises to the customer.

- Ensure optimal customer support by customer service representatives and salespople, both in the field and in the office.

- Provide maximum communication from salesople and customer service to the field service organization and technicians.

- Ensure an optimal supply of parts for the field service organization without cannibalizing parts for production and/other customer service.

- Provide the actual "as-built" information on the equipment that the technicians are servicing.

- Provide feedback on actual field results to the quality and design engineers so that the engineers can iprove products and reduce total installed costs.

- Integrate with warranty tracking information on supplied components.

- Integrate with customer maintenance contracts.

- Integrate with accounting.

- Integrate with Human Resources.
