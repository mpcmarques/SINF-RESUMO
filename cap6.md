# CAP 6 - What is an ERP System? _(slide 2)_

- Are packaged software designed for a client server environment, whether traditional or web-based.
- Integrate the majority of a business processes.
- Process a large majority of an organization's transactions.
- Use an enterprise-wide database that typically stores each piece of data once.
- ERP systems allow acces to the data in real time.
- In some cases, ERP allows an integration of transaction processing and planning activities (e.g. production planning).

## Additional Characteristics _(slide 2)_

- Support for multiple currencies and languages.
- Support for specific industries.
- Ability to customize without programmming (change settings).

## ERP Partners _(slide 2)_

- Enterprise resource planning firms do not implement all the software they sell.
- Instead they typically work with a wide range of partners in order to implement the software.

## Modules and Add-ons _(slide 2)_

ERP Modules

- Enterprise resource planning systems can include a wide range of functionality, using components that are often referred to as modules.

## Best of Breed _(slide 3)_

Generally, firms choose a single ERP package for implementation.

However, a number of firms choose a best of breed approach where they attempt **to mix and match modules in a way that best meets their needs**

Why would anyone want to do it?

Benefits: ideally the fiem will get the system and functionality that they want with the heterogenous system.

### Best of Breed - Costs _(slide 4)_

- **First**: The search costs generally would be larger, since any module that might possibly meet the firm's needs should be considered.
- **Second**: the look-and-feel of the modules may differ, may result in increased education or reprogramming.
- **Third**: different modules will need to be interfaced with each other. This cost could be substantital.
- **Fourth**: is likely to require a diversified team, where the implementors' expectations are not likely to be as well specified.
- **Fifth**: ERP systems have new versions every two to five years.
- **Sixth**: if different branches of the firm emply different solutions to the best of breed then there may be no commonality between systems, curatiling one of the primary advantages of ERP.

## Configuring ERP Systems _(slide 4)_

Means making choices about:

- The models
- Artifacts
- Processes

### Models _(slide 5)_

A number of models are embbeded within ERP systems:

These models are representations of the world encompassed by the system, and their quality is important for captyring reality. E.g. organizational structures model.

#### Benefits _(slide 5)_

They can provide the system with the degree of organizational detail required to model the firm.

#### Costs _(slide 5)_

If the model changes then it must be changed in the system.

### Artifacts _(slide 5)_

Commonly known as **documents**, **are generated by systems as outputs** (e.g. invoices) or used by the systems as inputs (customers orders). Enterprise artifcats that are instantiations of the models (e.g. vendor lists) provide structure to the enterprise systems.

### Processes _(slide 5)_

Are the activity and information flows necessary to accomplish a particular task of set of tasks.

**Organizations must choose processes that will meet their needs.**

- processes **are not unique**.
- since they are not unique, it is expected that some processes will work better than others.**Within ERP systems there are multiple cross-functional processes.**

## ERP - trua ambition _(slide 6)_

Attempts to integrate all departments and functions onto a single system.

Combines them all together into a single, integrated program that runs off a single database.

Covers the techniques and concepts employed for the integrated management of business as a whole, from the viewpoint of the effective use of management, resources, to improve the efficiency of an enterprise.

## ERP Packages _(slide 7)_

Are integrated software packages that support these concepts:

- converts transactional data into useful information and collates the data so that they can be analyzed.
- standardizes an enterprise's business processes and data.
- leads to all of the collected transactional data become information that companies can use to support business decisions.

## Benefits of an ERP system _(slide 7)_

- Business integration.
- Flexability.
- Better analysis and planning capabilities.
- use of latest technology.

### Business integrations _(slide 7)_

Automatic data "updation" that is possible among the related business components.

### Flexibility _(slide 7)_

Different languages, currencies, accounting standards covered in one system and locations.

### Use of latest technology

Take advantage of the latest technologies like client/server, e-commerce.

## Other benefits of an ERP

- Reduction of lead-time, on-time shipment.
- Reduction in cycle time, better customer satisfaction.
- Improved supplier performance, increased flexibility.
- Reduction in quality costs, improved resource utility.
- Improved information accuracy and enhanced decision-making capability.
