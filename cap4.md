# Lecture 4

## Engineering Integration _(slide 1)_

MRP 2 systems traditionally interfaced (meaning unintelligent data transfer) with engineering design systems to receive BOM and routing information.

A product's cost (90%) is determined during the design cycle, its quality characteristics are also fundamentally determined during product design and process design.

## A fully integrated TEI includes _(slide 2)_

- The design process
- Product phase-out
- Product Data Management
- Integrating with customers
- Integrating with suppliers
- Integrating with the rest of the company
- Project management

## Those activities that are directly ERP-related include: _(slide 3)_

- Projected manufacturing cost.
- Projected production volumes.
- Engineering changes.

## Acitivies that are not directly ERP-related by are part of a total TEI system include: _(slide 3)_

- Customer requiriments (features and functions).
- Customer wants and desires.
- Technical functionality.
- Manufacturing capabilities.
- Supplier capabilities.
- Projected sales price.
- The tradeoffs.
- Projected costs for support in the field, or for warranty replacements.
- Projected time to manufacture/time to respons to a customer order.
- Projected future upgrade paths.
- Projected time to manufacture/time to respond to a customer order.
- Projected future upgrade paths.
- Projected cost of recycling.

## Concurrent Engineering _(slide 3)_

Involves all departments and functions in design sessions from the start.

Thereby dramatically reducing the elapsed design time and allowing a company to bring its product to market more quickly.

### Project design as a sequential exercise has 3 serious drawbacks _(slide 4)_

- The total elapsed time is very long..
- When a downstream department wants to suggest changes to the design...
- None of the departments has real ownership of the process or the end result...

### Several studies have shown that time to market is much more important for long term product profitability than staying on budget.

### Concurrent Engineering has another major advantage _(slide 4)_

- Substantially **reduce the total manufacturing and procurement cost** of a product.
- Feedback from manufacturing professionals (hopefully, key suppliers), field service professionals, and others in a Concurrent Engineering environment.
- Can **contribute to a significantly lower total life-cycle cost for a product**.

## Design Stages _(slide 5)_

Core team performs the entire design process. The core team may include:

- Marketing, wich represents the customers.
- Design Engineering/ R&D.
- Manufacturng / Industrial Engineering.
- Manufacturing.
- Quality.
- Purchasing.
- Key suppliers.
- Can also include key customers!

### Stage 1: Initial Concept / Proof of Technology _(slide 5)_

  - Desired features and functions. These can come from a variety of sources.
  - The capabilities of manufacturing processes, both in house and suppliers.
- Created
  - Reports of results.
  - Technology summary.
  - Why decisions were made.

### Stage 2: Design optimization _(slide 6)_

The design, as it leaves this stage must meet several basic criteria:

### Stage 3: Marketing effort (in parallel with Step 2, design optimization). _(slide 7)_

#### Marketing's focus includes _(slide 7)_:

- Lookand feel of the product.
- Packaging.
- Marketplace positioning.

#### Information _(slide 8)_

  - Revised sales forecasts.

### Stage 4: Pilot production _(slide 8)_

Proving:

- The product itself.
- Te manufacturing process.
- The technical capabilities of the product.

#### Information _(slide 8)_

- Needed

  - Capital requirements.

### Stage 5: Product Lunch _(slide 9)_

#### Information Needed: _(slide 9)_

- Revised forecasts for product sales, from marketing.
- Capacity constraints at bottleneck processes in-house plants and at suppliers. (and alternatives, with cost and quality considerations) from manufacturing and purchasing.
- Material constraints, from materials planning and purchasing.
- Other resource contraints (e.g. ackaging in the volumes required), from materials planning and master scheduling.
- Capital constraints, limiting investment in plant and equipment and advertising.
- Revised designs and specifications, from design engineering.
- Regulatory clearance, if necessary.

#### Information created: _(slide 9)_

- Production plans, which feed the TEI systems so that it can plan requirements and schedules for materials, capacity and other resources.
- Product launch plans, including advertising, trade shows and promotions.

### Stage 6: Follow up _(slide 10)_

#### Information needed _(slide 10)_

- Results of the design process
- Actual product sales, from marketing
- Warranty returns from the marketing, with reasons for failure from quality.
- Customer complaints and suggestions, from marketing and sales.

#### Information created _(slide 10)_

- Revised packaging.
- Revised marketing plans.
- Lessons learned.

#### Participants _(slide 11)_

- The core team, with Marketing, Design, Engineering R&D, and Quality assuming primary responsibility.
- Although not a member of the core team, Sales can have a primary role.
- Other participants can include key customers.

### Stage 7: Engineering Changes _(slide 11)_

**No matter where changes originate each affected department in the manufacturer, plus all affected suppliers and sometimes customers, must be notified of the change!**

For example:

- Type of change (for example, new material, new or revised process, changes in tolerances, etc.).
- Effective date of change, or other type of phase-in (e.g. lot number).
- Urgency and seriousness of change, and whether retrofit of existing products is required.

#### Changes _(slide 12)_

- **At early stages** modest level of engineering control is appropriate so people are not making changes at will and so the company can learn from the changes.
- **As the product solidifies**, the level of formality increases!
- Most companies have **engineering change comittee** comprised of the same departments that re on product design teams.

#### Information _(slide 12)_

##### Needed

- Desired change.
- Demosntration of effectiveness of change.
- Availability of new resources.
- Inventories of existing components that are being phased out.
- Projected cost of the change.
- Ability to coordinate this change with others, to minimize changeover cost.

##### Created

- Engineering change documents, Bill of Material relationships (for material usage), routings (for process specifications), quality attributes.

## Product Phase-Out _(slide 12)_

Objectives:

- Reatin customer loyalty.
- Minimize expense, maximize revenues (for old product and new product).
- Minimize disruptions in the supply chain, both with customers and with suppliers.
- Minimize disruptions in the manufacturing process.

**Product Phase-Out is a decision which requires input and discussion from the departments below:**

- Marketing and Sales.
- Production.
- Materials and Purchasing.
- Human Resources.
- Engineering.
- Accounting.

## Product Data Management (PDM) _(slide 13)_

Originated in engineering departments concurrently with MRP 2's growth in the materials and manufacturing functions.

PDM and TEI overlap in product and process definitions and in controlling engineering changes.

Field service also uses PDM data when it maintains equpment.

### PDM software _(slide 13)_

- Manages and controls the product information necessary to specify, analyze, and ultimately build a product.
- It also coorditates the process used to create, review, release and change product information.
- PDM system sits on top of other application software and data files, including CAD/CAM Systems.

### A PDM system plays a number of roles _(slide 13)_

- It serves as a **librarian**, keeping track of the myriad of versions and thousands of anciallary files pertaining to a single product.
- A PDM system also acts as **trafic cop**
  - Ensuring that various parties all operate on the same master records in a secure manner.
- PDM software functions as **project manager**

  - by forwarding tasks automatically to the appropriate individuals when certain events occur.

### PDM Systems _(slide 13)_

Provides the technology for engineers to integrate with:

- **Customers**:
  - Linking with their systems, so that the manufacturer's engineers can easily exchange drawings, specifications, etc.
- **Suppliers**:
  - The same as costumers.
- **Field Service**:
  - so that field service technicians can access the detailed engineering drawings and specifications while they are servicing equipment in the field.

### PDM and TEI overlap _(slide 14)_

And therafore must link, in the following areas:

- BOM (Bill of Materials)
  - There are five potential ways to interface or integrate the two systems: No eletronic interaction; PDM is the master, TEI is the slave; PDM and TEI are equal; PDM is the engineering design workspace; TEI functionality include PDM.
- Routings.
- Engineering change control.

## Integrating with Customers _(slide 14)_

If customers have design enginereers, integrating the design process with customers engineers can:

- Reduce design error.
- Tighten the relationship between the two companies.
- Reduce costs.
- Reduce the manufacturer's time to respond to the customer.
- Increase the manufacturer's visibility.
- Improve performance and market acceptance of the final product.

**Industrial products manufacturers want more detail from process and product engineers at their customers.**
This can be provided in two ways:

- The manufacturer's engineers can visit the customer at relatively frequent intervals.
- The manufacturer can be invited to join de design team for new products, and for redisigning existing products.

## Integratins with Suppliers _(slide 14)_

If suppliers have design engineers, integrating the design process with suppliers engineers can:

- Reduce design errors.
- Tighten the relationship between the two companies.
- Reduce costs.
- Reduce the suppliers time to respond to the manufacturer.
- Improve performance and market acceptance of the final product.

### Integrating the design process with suppliers can include the following: _(slide 15)_

- Investing engineer time in suppliers to build a solid relationship.
- Single sourcing as a matter of policy.
- Inviting the suppliers to participate in designing new products and redesigning existing products.
- Working collaboratively with suppliers to jointly develop the best alternatives.
- Providing specifications in a format that the supplier can readly use.
- Communicating and controlling engineering changes.
- Receiving, hearing, and acting uppon communications from the suppliers.

## Integrating with the Rest of the Company _(slide 15)_

The philosophy of the engineering department directly affects the amount of data it gathers and the circumstances under which it gathers the data.

Engineering can be:

- Reactive or Proactive.
- Service or Supplier to the shop fllor or other internal costumers.
